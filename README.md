- This bot has been created to weigh up the sentiment of any and all websites provided in the requirements.txt file, provided they have any relevant information to the subject at hand.
- This bot also has the capability to store and access the results in a database, is compatible with selenium and headerless webpages, and is optimised by asynchronous processing and some C++ rewriting to bypass the GIL and the deadlocks and race conditions it created.
- This repository has been created by myself for fun and practice of web scraping analysis.
- I will not add any users to this repository to protect and preserve the normal function and maintenance of the project.
- If anyone has a query about the function and usage of the repository, send me a message request.
